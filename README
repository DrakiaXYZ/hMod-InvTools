 Description
=============
A basic tool invincibility plugin, I created this as I noticed lag issues with 
the existing Invincible Tools plugin.

=============
 Features
=============
Ability to toggle invincibility on a per-item basis.
Invincibility can be enabled on a per-group basis:
	1) Edit InvTools.properties and set "groupPolicy=true"
	2) Give the appropriate groups access to "/InvTools" to enable
Tools are only "repaired" when their damage reaches a certain threshold.

=============
 Properties
=============
groupPolicy - A boolean that selects whether enabling is based on groups.
Tools - A comma-separated list of item IDs that should be invincible.
RepairPoint - An integer that sets the minimum damage an item is repaired at.

=============
 Known Bugs
=============
- Items can be destroyed if used to attack.
- If multiples of the same item are equipped, the lowest slot will be recreated 
  instead of the one in the players hand.

 Compiling
=============
Place "Minecraft_Mod.jar" and "minecraft_server.jar" in "hMod-InvTools", load
the project in Eclipse, and export a JAR.
